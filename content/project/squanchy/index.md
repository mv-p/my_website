Squanchy is a cat-like anthropomorphic creature that was invited to Rick and Summer's party in "Ricksy Business". He is a recurring character in Rick and Morty, and very good friends with Rick, sharing his love for alcohol. Morty and Jessica first meet Squanchy engaging in auto-erotic asphyxiation masturbation in Morty's garage. This marks the first among many things he refers to as "squanching."

In "The Wedding Squanchers," after Tammy reveals herself as a deep cover agent for the Galactic Federation and the wedding reception is ambushed by Gromflomites, Squanchy tells Rick to save his family and get out of there before pulling out one of his teeth and breaking it in half to consume a green liquid substance which subsequently turns him into a giant version of himself with superhuman strength and endurance. At the end of the episode it is hinted to that Squanchy may have died in the fight against the Gromflamites when Rick drops the photo of Birdperson, Squanchy and himself. This hint is reinforced in the post credits scene of "The Rickshank Rickdemption" when Tammy is revealed to be alive and unharmed as Squanchy was last seen fighting her.
