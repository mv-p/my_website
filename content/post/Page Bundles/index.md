# Sample of a header 

Writing a post is fairly straight forward using Markdown. For example, we can add **bold text**, 
[external links](https://www.adultswim.com/videos/rick-and-morty/), or embed figures from the post folder:
{{< figure src="mrpb.jpg" title="Arguably the best character of the show" >}}

I encourage you to get familiar with [Markdown] (https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to get the most out of the language.
